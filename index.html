<h1 class="red" id="jack">Live in a foreign country</h1>
<h2 class="sansserif">1. OVERCOME THE CULTURAL SHOCK</h2>
<p class="serif">This is going to be the first and the hardest step of all. Open up your mind to fresh impressions by letting go of negative cliches. Be flexible in your thoughts and adopt a live and let live attitude.
Step out of your safety net and engage in local activities. If you want to get accustomed to the ways of a foreign country, it is going to be you who has to put in the maximum efforts.
Make an attempt to learn the foreign language and observe the country's way of life. Pick up only the positives and learn what not to do from the negatives.
Get to know different people. Make good friends.
Keep an optimistic attitude and be patient till you get settled in. Remember you can always just be yourself as well as enjoy living abroad.
</p>
<h3 class="sansserif"> AWAY FROM HOME</h3>
<p class="serif" class="green">One of the major drawbacks of this adventure is that you are away from the people you love the most. Loneliness is quite common in this phase but make sure that it doesn't get the better of you.
Keep a routine for yourself. Go out and learn something new each day.
Internet is always there which will not only keep you connected to your family but also provide free entertainment in the form of books, music, and movies creating a home-like atmosphere.
If you have relatives or friends in that country make sure to keep their local numbers and catch up with them. A familiar face is the best cure for homesickness.</p>

<h4 class="sansserif">3. EVERYDAY IS A STEP FORWARD</h4>
<p class="serif" class="blue">Remember that everything is difficult when it is being done for the first time.
Giving yourself sufficient time is the best gift.
Try to enjoy the little things around you like a new restaurant or different company.
Get hold of a map. Explore places and whenever you feel like giving up remind yourself that you've come this far and you have only a little more to go to achieve your goal.</p>
<h5 class="sansserif">4. STUDY HARD</h5>
<p class="serif">Keep in mind that you've come abroad to study or set your careers so give it all you've got.
Once you set into your study or work routine you won't have much time on your hands, and you will start getting used to the lifestyle.</p>
